## Julia fractal:

The Julia fractal is a popular model for chaotic behaviour, in which a small perturbation causes a drastic change to the value of a dynamic 
system.

One popular way to model the Julia set is the number of iterations needed for the process [img]http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=z%20%3D%20z%5E2%20%2B%20c&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0[/img] where c is a constant complex number
to reach a particular threshold for the absolute value of z.

Each point (x,y) in the 2D image is mapped to a particular value of z and the brightness/intensity of each point corresponds to the number of
iterations taken by the above process
